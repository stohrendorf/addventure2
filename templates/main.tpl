    <h3>Hello little tree climber!</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>This is the all-new Addventure.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Well... in fact, it is the same Addventure.
        But better: watered, mucked, and polled, so that it is way more pleasant to look at.
        You'll even find some new flowers here and there between the limbs:
    <ul>
        <li>RSS and ATOM feeds of the newest buds.</li>
        <li>Better tools to let new leaves sprout.</li>
        <li>Hearts carved into the wood, telling you how much a branch is loved.</li>
        <li>bla bla bla...</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Rules for everyone</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Be kind!</li>
    <li>It's easy to break the storyline by introducing a new twist.  Try to write new episodes as if they were a seamless proceeding.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't</strong> overuse <span class="text-warning">formatting</span>.  Think of people who are dressed <span style="color:magenta;">way too fancy</span> and/or have put <em>so much makeup</em> on their faces that they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">look like an oil painting.</span></li>
    <li>You can <em>intend</em> a direction for sequels, but don't try to <em>force</em> it.</li>
    <li>Watch out for you're spelling.  It's distarcting if theirs to much worng.</li>
    <li>DON'T OVERUSE CAPITALS!!! OR PUNCTUATION!!!!!!!</li>
</ul>
