About...
========

This is the main Addventure2 repository.  It aims to be a full replacement for the old
Addventure system, but with additional and improved features.


How to install?
===============
If you haven't already, get composer:
```
$ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then, you can install the current development version of the Addventure2:
```
$ php composer.phar create-project -s dev application/addventure /path/to/addventure
```


What is the current state?
==========================
It's usable for now, though some administrative functionality is not implemented yet, such as user management or deleting/editing episodes.
